# pomodoro
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where you work in focused 25-minute intervals, known as pomodoros, followed by a five-minute break. After completing four pomodoros, you take a well-deserved 20-minute break. This approach is highly effective because it:

Improves focus
Minimizes distractions
Prevents burnout
Promotes accountability
Boosts motivation
This technique is particularly beneficial for perfectionists and procrastinators. Committing to just 25 minutes of work at a time is much easier than facing an entire afternoon of continuous work.
